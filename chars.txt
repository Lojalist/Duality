#Usage of Characters and Animations

1: Characters
--------------
tested with "Bearpocalypse" from "Mecanim GDC 2013"
and the "A03"-char from "Female Warrior Princess 1.0" -  also form Mechanim! -> Merging should be "easy" 

	+ 'bearapocalypse'
		-> in hierachy select player->dude:
		-> inspector shows following scripts:
			-Player 		-> "Base script" - seems like binding animation to keyboard / joystick (also logging stuff)
			-Recorder		-> "works like animator" -> brings textures and animations to skeleton(?)
			-Look Ahead		-> player looks into direction of contoller (while running)
			-Action			-> brings the slide/jump actions to the player woks with Animator & CharacterController
			-Damage Receiver	-> what happens when the player is hit? - again works with animator
			-Bazooka		-> not shure----this seems like giving the Player a Bazooka.....but i didnt find one on the field....
			-Player_Shoot		-> does what it sounds like - player shoots bubbles....from the bazooka?
			-Karma			-> defines what happens when the player falls out of the world -> reset above ground
	
	+ 'Princess'
		-> select the 'A03'- Prefab and place it into the environment - change the 'TAG' in inspector to 'Player'
		-> Camera form this example is connectet to Character - remove it!
		-> inspector on whole Player object has only the 'CharacterDemoContoller'
		 	- Uses only the "update"- methode to implement movement etc
			- mouse movements could be exchange  for keyboard movements (now moves to the point that is clicked at)
				-somehow this is conectet to the floor that she walks on......
				- she also always moves (rotates) when the weapons are changed
				- have to connect her somehow with the floor - [CANNOT MOVE]
	
	+ Conclusion:
		-> Seems like all Charakters have a "ROOT"-point that brings up the Motion-skelton:
			+Princess : 	
				- under ROOT there are 'hips' as well as Left / Right thigh and a spine	
				- ths structure goes to some body parts
3: Use of 3rd Person camera
--------------
	+ looks quite easy
		-> Camera is Placed somewhere inside the world
		-> set the script "ThirdPersonCamera"
		-> tries to follow the "Player"-tagged object

	====> Thats it -> 3rd Person work	====> Thats it -> 3rd Person works

4: use mouse or Keyboard to controll
--------------
	+ movement for Warrior Princes is done by using the mouse to click on places -> like in Diablo etc.
	+ movement for Dude is done by keyboard or Joystick movement  -> I guess we prefer this one
	
	+ Problem here is to convert the movement from one Char to the other
		-> try to teach the princess to listen to Keyboard
		-> or 
		-> try to make the Dude look like the princess?
	
		-> Dude has smooth movements and is used quite intuitiv to play
		-> Princess has "onBoard" fighting and preconfigured weapons (including Animations)
